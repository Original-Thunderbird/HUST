### 1. Getting Started
I have prepared all the installers needed for the environment.

Go to Env and install DosBox first, then place td.exe everything inside MASM.rar under DosBox working directory, that's all for environment.

Inside DosBox,
```
MASM (filename)
```
to get corresponding .obj, then
```
LINK (filename)
```
to get binary.
