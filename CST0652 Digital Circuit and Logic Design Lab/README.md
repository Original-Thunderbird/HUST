2.5 Access Control System is an integration fo 2.1 to 2.3.

### 1. Getting Started
Open each project in Logisim, enter simulation mode.

For 2.5 Simulation, go to "Encapsulation", There are 3 buttons: CPU count up; CPD count down; CLR reset count to 0. When count reaches max (15) and continue to count up, warning will be given.

For Project, there are 2 modes (red lingt shining/traffic control) and 4 speeds (1/2/4/8 clock cycle per switch)
